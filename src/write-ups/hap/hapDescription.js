export const hapDescription = `I was initally selected to do only 1 react based application for their new website for one of the brand.
I ended working for 2nd application which was legacy app migration to a new cloud based react app. The reason for doing 2 projects for this
company was the speed at which I completed both the projects and with quality. The 1st application was NextJs, wordpress, styled components,
typescript based fun tour website for hiring employeed during their hiring season. The 2nd application was a much tougher and complicated project, 
which included Nextjs, node, java, aws, jquery, security practices, ADA compliance, and others. Worked on this project for 1 and half 
and completed within the timeframe which was already short. This application sits between many other application, which is accessed 
by their partners and internal employees to book cruises and ancillary services to cruises.
