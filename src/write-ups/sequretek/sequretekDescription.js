    This project was about developing multiple applications. The project was divided into inhouse application and customer facing application.
    The inhouse application was heavy data visualization and chat based application. The external customer facing application was 
    a user friendly, simple design cyber security website for marketing of the company. Both the applications had different tech
    stacks and very different outlook. The project was very complex and moving across the application for developing made it more
    difficult.
