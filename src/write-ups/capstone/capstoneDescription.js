    This was the capstone project for my masters degree. We developed an AI based mobile travel application also known as personalized
    travel agent. Imagine, you are traveling to a new country, state or a city and you want to explore the area.
    This application solves the problem of deciding which locations to visit for your trip to become a fun trip. The application
    would ask simple questions and provide you with a list of locations to visit based on your previous travel stops and your taste.
    The application would even plan an itinerary personalized for you for the number of days you want.
